-- plan clean seed
-- Business rule:
-- - plan is a distribution container, not a self-owned annual container.
-- - Seed both baseline matrices:
--   1) 系统管理员部门(战略发展部) -> 各职能部门
--   2) 各职能部门 -> 各二级学院
-- - Runtime backend must also auto-heal missing plan rows when new organizations are added.
-- Status rule:
-- - plan.status is the authoritative package-level distribution status.
-- - indicator.status may exist as a downstream projection/lifecycle field, but when the two
--   differ, plan.status is the source-of-truth for the overall package.
-- - All clean-seed plan containers stay at the DRAFT baseline.
